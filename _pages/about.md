I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the School of Cyberspace Security, Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), working under the joint supervision of Prof. Deqing Zou and Prof. Haoyu Wang. I received my Ph.D. in Cyberspace Security from the School of Cyberspace Security, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) in June 2025, where I was advised by Prof. Guo'ai Xu. My research interests primarily focus on leveraging AI technologies to address security and privacy issues in software engineering. During my PhD, I have published 3 CCF A papers, which improve Android malware detection by utilizing DNN uncertainty at the data layer ([MalCleanse](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3715769)), model training layer ([MalTutor](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3728884)), and inference layer ([MalCertain](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3597503.3639122)). Currently, I am exploring the security challenges of LLMs and how LLMs can be applied to solve security problems.
